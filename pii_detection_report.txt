PII DETECTION REPORT
======================

RISK ASSESSMENT:
  - HIGH: first_name, last_name, email, phone, date_of_birth, address
    (Direct identifiers — names, contact details, DOB, address
     combine to uniquely identify and locate any individual.)
  - MEDIUM: income
    (Financial sensitivity — income reveals economic status
     and is protected under many privacy regulations.)

EXPOSURE RISK:
  If this dataset were breached, attackers could:
  - Phish customers (have full email addresses)
  - Spoof identities (have names + DOB + address)
  - Social engineer targets (have phone numbers)
  - Financial profiling (have income levels)
  - At-risk individuals: ALL 15 customers (100.0% of dataset)

MITIGATION: Mask all PII before sharing with analytics teams.
  Apply column-level masking (names, emails, phones, addresses, DOBs).
  Retain only customer_id, income, account_status, created_date for
  analytics purposes — or tokenise income into brackets.
